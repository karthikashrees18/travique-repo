You are an expert full-stack developer.
Create a complete MERN-style full-stack project called `travel-guide-app` that runs locally in VS Code with minimal setup.

The app should be a modern, visually appealing **travel companion website** with the following features:

1. **Offline Map (OpenStreetMap + Leaflet)**
   - Fetch and display the user’s current location using the browser’s geolocation API.
   - Display an OpenStreetMap map using `react-leaflet`.
   - Allow zoom, markers, and basic map interaction.
   - Implement manual offline map image saving (cache tiles using service workers).

2. **Group Travel Feature**
   - Users can create and join travel groups based on **interest**, **vibe**, or **destination**.
   - Each group shows its name, description, and a “Join” button.
   - Store user info and group memberships in the backend.
   - Backend API endpoints: `/groups`, `/groups/:id/join`, `/users`.

3. **Solo Travel Feature**
   - Detect nearby solo travelers (using geolocation).
   - Show a list of nearby travelers with their name and social media link (e.g., Instagram).
   - Clicking a traveler’s name redirects to their social link.
   - Backend supports nearby user lookup (within 10 km).

4. **Emergency Info Page**
   - Display local emergency contact numbers such as police, ambulance, and fire.
   - Data can be hard-coded or fetched from a JSON file like:
     ```json
     {"police": "100", "ambulance": "108", "fire": "101"}
     ```
   - Include “Call Now” buttons for mobile view.

5. **Itinerary Planner**
   - A search bar that lets the user look for “restaurants”, “parks”, or “temples”.
   - Use the OpenStreetMap (Nominatim) API to show nearby results on the map.
   - Add markers for results and show place names in a sidebar list.

6. **Styling & Design**
   - Use **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS** for the frontend.
   - Make it visually appealing with a clean travel theme: soft blue tones, rounded cards, soft shadows, responsive grid layout, and modern typography.
   - Add a top navigation bar linking to Map, Groups, Solo, Emergency, and Itinerary pages.

7. **Backend & Database**
   - Use **Node.js + Express.js**.
   - Database: **SQLite** (either plain SQLite or Prisma ORM).
   - Enable **CORS** so the frontend and backend communicate smoothly.
   - Include working example endpoints for all features.

8. **Project Setup Requirements**
   - The project must run locally in VS Code with these commands:
     ```
     npm install
     npx prisma generate
     npx prisma db push
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Include `.env` example values if needed (e.g., database path).

9. **Folder Structure**

10. **Output Instructions**
 - Output the **complete file tree** and **exact contents of each file**.
 - Add short comments explaining each major section or function.
 - Ensure the app opens in the browser and displays the styled homepage with all the above features.



The goal is a ready-to-run project that I can copy directly into VS Code and run using the commands above to see the travel companion web app.
